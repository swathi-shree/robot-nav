COMPSYS726: Assignment 1 Resources
==================================

There are two example worlds in this file:
* example_1.world: an empty room
* example_2.world: the same room as example_1.world but with obstacles in it

To start Gazebo with one of the worlds use the following command from the terminal:

roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=$PWD/worlds/filename

Where filename is the name of the file containing a world (e.g. example_2.world).
